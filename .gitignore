# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring
# files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# MY NOTE: Everything below this line is added by us

# Ignore all RubyMine specific files.
# Feel free to remove this if you are not using RubyMine as your IDE.
/.idea/*

# Ignore RVM/other Ruby version manager config files. These are only for auto-
# selecting the correct Ruby and gemset locally. It is a good idea to generate
# these files for yourself. If using RVM, do so by typing this on the command
# line, in the project root directory:
#    rvm --ruby-version use some-ruby-version@some-gemset
#
# Learn more at https://rvm.io/workflow/projects
.ruby-version
.ruby-gemset

# Ignore all OS X specific .DS_Store files.
# Ideally, you should ignore this globally. However, it is quite easy to forget,
# so we include it here. Feel free to remove if you are not using OS X, or have
# ignored it globally.
**/*.DS_Store
