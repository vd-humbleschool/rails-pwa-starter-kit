      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      MY NOTE: Added this script to enable service workers, a PWA requirement.
      Adapted from https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/blob/master/demo/app/js/service-worker-registration.js
      Apart from this script, did a few other things to enable service workers:
      * Added the 'sw-precache' dev dependency to package.json
      * Created the sw-precache-config.js file to tell sw-precache which files
        should be cached, i.e. made available for the app to work offline
      * Updated the build instructions in package.json to have sw-precache
        generate the service worker code to cache the desired files
